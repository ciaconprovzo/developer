AirBox supports a wide range of video and audio formats from almost every known platform for production. It also allows simultaneous output of two or more SDI or IP streams in any combination needed to deliver the content[^1^]. AirBox can accommodate virtually any media file format for playout, including third-party video server files like Leitch, Seachange, etc[^1^].
 
AirBox enables playlist scheduling for weeks ahead for automated playout. Any changes to the playlist during on-air session are possible.

Playback order can be changed on-the-fly with commands like skip to next or jump. Such order changes are performed seamlessly without stopping the current playout session[^1^].
